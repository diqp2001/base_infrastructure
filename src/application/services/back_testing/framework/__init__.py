"""
Algorithm Framework Module

This module implements the algorithm framework structure similar to QuantConnect's 
Algorithm.Framework, providing a systematic approach to algorithm components including:

- Portfolio Management: Portfolio construction and optimization algorithms
- Risk Management: Risk models and management techniques
- Execution: Trade execution algorithms and models
- Selection: Security and alpha model selection

The framework is designed to provide modular, reusable components that can be 
easily combined to create sophisticated trading algorithms.
