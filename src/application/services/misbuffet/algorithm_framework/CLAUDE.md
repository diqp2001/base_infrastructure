# Algorithm Framework

## Overview

The Algorithm Framework provides a structured approach to algorithm development by separating trading logic into distinct, reusable components. This follows the QuantConnect Lean algorithm framework pattern, enabling modular algorithm construction and better code organization.

## Architecture

The algorithm framework is organized into specialized modules:

```
algorithm_framework/
├── portfolio/          # Portfolio construction models
├── risk/              # Risk management models
├── alpha/             # Alpha generation models (future)
├── execution/         # Execution models (future)
└── universe/          # Universe selection models (future)
```

## Core Components

### 1. Portfolio Construction Models
Location: `portfolio/`

Portfolio construction models determine how to allocate capital across selected securities based on alpha signals and risk constraints.

**Key Features:**
- Black-Litterman optimization
- Mean-variance optimization
- Risk parity models
- Custom allocation strategies

### 2. Risk Management Models
Location: `risk/`

Risk management models monitor and control portfolio risk exposure during algorithm execution.

**Key Features:**
- Maximum drawdown limits
- Position sizing controls
- Sector exposure limits
- Volatility-based risk management

## Usage in Algorithm Flow

The Algorithm Framework fits into the overall backtesting flow as follows:

1. **Algorithm Factory** creates algorithm instances
2. **Algorithm Framework** components are instantiated:
   - Portfolio construction models
   - Risk management models
   - Alpha generation models
3. **Base Algorithm Class** orchestrates framework components
4. **Common Interfaces** define contracts for all components

## Example Usage

```python
from back_testing.algorithm_framework.portfolio import BlackLittermanPortfolioOptimizationAlgorithm
from back_testing.algorithm_framework.risk import MaximumDrawdownRiskModel
from back_testing.common.interfaces import IAlgorithm

class MyFrameworkAlgorithm(IAlgorithm):
    def initialize(self):
        # Set up portfolio construction
        self.portfolio_construction = BlackLittermanPortfolioOptimizationAlgorithm()
        
        # Set up risk management
        self.risk_management = MaximumDrawdownRiskModel(max_drawdown=0.1)
        
        # Initialize framework components
        self.portfolio_construction.initialize()
        self.risk_management.initialize()
    
    def on_data(self, data):
        # Generate alpha signals
        alpha_signals = self.generate_alpha_signals(data)
        
        # Construct portfolio
        target_weights = self.portfolio_construction.create_targets(alpha_signals)
        
        # Apply risk management
        adjusted_weights = self.risk_management.manage_risk(target_weights)
        
        # Execute trades
        self.execute_trades(adjusted_weights)
```

## Component Development

### Creating Portfolio Construction Models

Portfolio construction models should inherit from `PortfolioConstructionModel` and implement required methods:

```python
from back_testing.algorithm.portfolio import PortfolioConstructionModel

class MyPortfolioModel(PortfolioConstructionModel):
    def create_targets(self, alpha_signals):
        # Implement portfolio construction logic
        pass
    
    def on_securities_changed(self, changes):
        # Handle security universe changes
        pass
```

### Creating Risk Management Models

Risk management models should inherit from `RiskManagementModel` and implement required methods:

```python
from back_testing.algorithm.risk import RiskManagementModel

class MyRiskModel(RiskManagementModel):
    def manage_risk(self, targets):
        # Implement risk management logic
        pass
    
    def on_securities_changed(self, changes):
        # Handle security universe changes
        pass
```

## Framework Benefits

1. **Modularity**: Components can be developed and tested independently
2. **Reusability**: Framework components can be shared across algorithms
3. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes code easier to maintain
4. **Testability**: Individual components can be unit tested
5. **Flexibility**: Components can be easily swapped or combined

## Integration with Base Algorithm

The framework components integrate with the base algorithm class through well-defined interfaces:

```python
# In base algorithm class
class BaseAlgorithm:
    def __init__(self):
        self.portfolio_construction = None
        self.risk_management = None
        self.alpha_model = None
    
    def set_portfolio_construction(self, model):
        self.portfolio_construction = model
    
    def set_risk_management(self, model):
        self.risk_management = model
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep Components Focused**: Each component should have a single responsibility
2. **Use Interfaces**: Always implement the required interfaces
3. **Handle Exceptions**: Implement proper error handling in all methods
4. **Document Parameters**: Clearly document all configuration parameters
5. **Test Thoroughly**: Write comprehensive unit tests for all components

## Future Enhancements

The framework will be extended with additional components:

- **Alpha Models**: Signal generation and research
- **Execution Models**: Smart order routing and execution
- **Universe Selection**: Dynamic security selection
- **Data Models**: Custom data integration
- **Insights**: Algorithm performance analytics
