  Separation of Concerns

Web â†’ controllers render Jinja2 templates, return HTML pages.

API â†’ controllers return JSON (Flask jsonify), no HTML.

Both layers call the same application services (e.g. BacktestService, PortfolioService)


 ðŸ“‚ interfaces/flask/flask.py

FlaskApp is only in the interfaces layer â†’ no domain logic.

Web & API logic live under interfaces/flask/web and interfaces/flask/api.

application.services are called inside controllers, not here.

This class is just glue: app creation, config, and route registration.

ðŸ“‚ interfaces/flask/

This is your presentation layer (interface adapters in DDD).
It connects the outside world (HTTP requests) to your application services.
Everything Flask-specific stays here, isolated from your domain logic.

ðŸ“‚ web/

This is your HTML-based UI (dashboards, forms, reports).

controllers/ â†’ Flask view controllers that handle HTTP requests, call application.services, and render templates.

templates/ â†’ Jinja2 HTML templates. Can be designed in a tool like Bootstrap Studio / Figma â†’ HTML â†’ drop here.

static/ â†’ Static assets like CSS, JS, images. Served directly by Flask.

ðŸ‘‰ Typical flow: request â†’ web.controller â†’ application.service â†’ template (HTML)

ðŸ“‚ api/

This is your REST/JSON interface (programmatic access).

controllers/ â†’ Functions (Flask blueprints) that handle API endpoints, call application.services, and return JSON responses.

routes/ â†’ Organize your API route definitions (e.g. routes.py for registering endpoints). Keeps controllers thin and routes centralized.

ðŸ‘‰ Typical flow: request â†’ api.controller â†’ application.service â†’ JSON response

ðŸ”¹ Roles in Summary

web/controllers/

Contains controllers for serving HTML.

Example: dashboard_controller.py (renders dashboard.html).

web/templates/

Contains .html files with Jinja2 placeholders for data from controllers.

web/static/

Assets: CSS, JS, images.

api/controllers/

API logic: each file groups endpoints by domain (e.g. backtest_controller.py).

Thin: should just validate request, call service, format response.

api/routes/

Route registrations.

Keeps blueprints and URL structures organized. Example: routes.py might register /api/backtest with the backtest_controller.

âœ… This way:

Your web UI and API are cleanly separated.

Both call into application/services (so business logic is reused).

Flask never leaks into domain or infrastructure.


examples:


interfaces/api/routes/routes.py:

from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from application.services.backtest_service import BacktestService

api_bp = Blueprint("api", __name__, url_prefix="/api")

@api_bp.route("/backtest", methods=["POST"])
def run_backtest():
    params = request.json
    service = BacktestService()
    results = service.run(params)
    return jsonify(results.to_dict())

interfaces/web/controllers/dashboard_controller.py:
from flask import Blueprint, render_template, request
from application.services.backtest_service import BacktestService

web_bp = Blueprint("web", __name__)

@web_bp.route("/")
def home():
    return render_template("index.html")

@web_bp.route("/backtest", methods=["POST"])
def run_backtest():
    params = request.form
    service = BacktestService()
    results = service.run(params)
    return render_template("results.html", results=results)
